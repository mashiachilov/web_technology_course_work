# WebTechnologyCW_00013786
This is an web page created by 00013786 for web technology course work WIUT 
I have chosen udevs.io for my course work. in this course project I have used html, css, js with scroll library to make web pages animated. 
the reason that I have chooses this web site is that it also an IT company that has thousand projects world wide and many more project across uzbekistan
apart from that it was really interesting project since main web site was created mostly in JS and many other programming languages with also their librarier. it was not that easy to make an animation as its in the original website that is why I had to use scroll library to make a little more interesting which give a web page a little bit of fun.

all the logos and extra photos has been adapted from original web site. 
I have deployed my web site on netlify in URL (00013786.netlify.app). during my project prepariation I have faced several problems one of those was header section and mobile version of my web page. problem was in the mobile version dropdown menu was disappering and it was not showing photos then problem has been fixed the help of miscalculated pxiels which is I have used -600px but it originally suppose to be -660px. 
majority of the bugs have been terminated with the help of my teacher.
